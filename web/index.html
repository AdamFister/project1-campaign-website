    <div>
    <p>Jean-Luc Picard is a celebrated Starfleet officer, archaeologist and diplomat who has served 
        throughout much of the 24th century. The highlights of his career are centered around 
        assignments as commanding officer of the Federation starships USS Stargazer, USS 
        Enterprise-D, and the USS Enterprise-E. In these roles, Picard not only witnessed 
        major turning points of recent galactic history, but played a key role in them also, 
        from making first contact as captain of the Federation's flagship with no fewer than 
        27 alien species, including the Ferengi and the Borg.</p>

        <p>He also became the chief contact point with the Q Continuum, and served as Arbiter of 
        Succession of the Klingon Empire, where he presided over the investiture of Chancellor 
        Gowron. Picard would expose the Romulan Star Empire as backers of Gowron's chief rivals, 
        later aiding a Romulan underground movement of dissidents to gain a toehold on the Romulan 
        homeworld. He has continued to serve as captain of the Enterprise-E, the sixth Federation 
        starship to bear the name, until at least 2379</p>

                    <p>Jean-Luc Picard was born in La Barre, France on Earth to Maurice and 
                        Yvette Picard on July 13, 2305. He and his 
                        elder brother, Robert, spent their childhood tending to their family 
                        vineyards with their father. Concerned about the preservation of their 
                        familial values, Maurice and his wife educated their sons in the ancient 
                        traditions, avoiding, in particular, any superfluous technologies.</p>

                        <p>As a child, Jean-Luc took piano lessons but eventually 
                            gave it up because he dreaded performing in front of an audience. 
                            In his later life, 
                            he would regret doing so because his playing used to please his mother. 
                            Young Jean-Luc dreamed of adventure and exploration. 
                            He was fond of starships, of which he liked to build models. 
                             Moreover, he was captivated by the Phoenix, 
                             the first Human warp-capable starship, which he admired several times 
                             at the Smithsonian Institution, but was never able to touch. 
                             Like his nephew Ren√©, 
                            Jean-Luc wrote a ribbon-winning report on starships.</p>

                            <p>Although Maurice intended his sons to work at the vineyards, 
                                it became obvious very early that Jean-Luc knew he wanted 
                                to join Starfleet, something that his father would never condone, 
                                up until his death. Jean-Luc would later 
                                remember that he devoted his childhood to that end, which was 
                                like skipping that age altogether. His 
                                brother would later note that Jean-Luc always sought higher standards, 
                                such as becoming president of his school and later a valedictorian 
                                and even an athletic champion. Robert was also jealous seeing Picard 
                                being the favored son and getting away after his mischiefs. 
                                
                            Sometimes Robert had to bully his younger brother. </p>
