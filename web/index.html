                        diplomat who has
                        served
                        throughout much of the 24th century. The highlights of his career are centered around
                        assignments as commanding officer of the Federation starships USS Stargazer, USS
                        Enterprise-D, and the USS Enterprise-E. In these roles, Picard not only witnessed
                        major turning points of recent galactic history, but played a key role in them also,
                        from making first contact as captain of the Federation's flagship with no fewer than
                        27 alien species, including the Ferengi and the Borg.</p>

                        Succession of the Klingon Empire, where he presided over the investiture of Chancellor
                        Gowron. Picard would expose the Romulan Star Empire as backers of Gowron's chief rivals,
                        later aiding a Romulan underground movement of dissidents to gain a toehold on the Romulan
                        homeworld. He has continued to serve as captain of the Enterprise-E, the sixth Federation
                        starship to bear the name, until at least 2379</p>

                    <p class="small">Jean-Luc Picard was born in La Barre, France on Earth to Maurice and
                        Yvette Picard on July 13, 2305. He and his
                        elder brother, Robert, spent their childhood tending to their family
                        vineyards with their father. Concerned about the preservation of their
                        familial values, Maurice and his wife educated their sons in the ancient
                        traditions, avoiding, in particular, any superfluous technologies.</p>
                    <p class="small">As a young boy, Jean-Luc watched his grandfather "deteriorate from a powerful,
                        intelligent figure to a frail wisp of a man, who could barely make his own way home."

                        One of Picard's childhood heroes was Dixon Hill, a fictional detective living in the early
                        20th
                        century. </p>

                    <p class="small">As a child, Jean-Luc took piano lessons but eventually
                        gave it up because he dreaded performing in front of an audience.
                        In his later life,
                        he would regret doing so because his playing used to please his mother.
                        Young Jean-Luc dreamed of adventure and exploration.
                        He was fond of starships, of which he liked to build models.
                        Moreover, he was captivated by the Phoenix,
                        the first Human warp-capable starship, which he admired several times
                        at the Smithsonian Institution, but was never able to touch.
                        Like his nephew Ren√©,
                        Jean-Luc wrote a ribbon-winning report on starships.</p>
                    <p class="small">Although Maurice intended his sons to work at the vineyards, it became obvious
                        very
                        early that Jean-Luc knew he wanted to join Starfleet, something that his father would never
                        condone, up until his death. Jean-Luc would later remember that he devoted his childhood to
                        that
                        end, which was like skipping that age altogether. His brother would later note that Jean-Luc
                        always sought higher standards, such as becoming president of his school and later a
                        valedictorian and even an athletic champion. Robert was also jealous seeing Picard being the
                        favored son and getting away after his mischiefs. Sometimes Robert had to bully his younger
                        brother.</p>

                    <p class="small">Although Maurice intended his sons to work at the vineyards,
                        it became obvious very early that Jean-Luc knew he wanted
                        to join Starfleet, something that his father would never condone,

                        like skipping that age altogether. His
                        brother would later note that Jean-Luc always sought higher standards,
                        such as becoming president of his school and later a valedictorian
                        and even an athletic champion. Robert was also jealous seeing Picard
                        being the favored son and getting away after his mischiefs.

                        Sometimes Robert had to bully his younger brother. </p>
                    <p class="small">Jean-Luc caused "quite a stir" by leaving his family's generational vineyard
                        and
                        applying to
                        Starfleet Academy. Although he failed to gain entry on his
                        first attempt, Picard succeeded in his second attempt in 2323. He subsequently became one of
                        the
                        most outstanding cadets in his class.</p>

                    <p class="small">
                        At the Academy, Picard developed an interest in archaeology. His professor, Richard Galen,
                        encouraged him to continue in this field, but Picard ultimately refused his offer of
                        becoming an
                        archaeologist. He would nevertheless keep his interest in the subject, and became to be
                        considered quite knowledgeable in the field.</p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Picard also excelled in sports. He won the Starfleet Academy marathon in April 2323 on
                        Danula
                        II, becoming the first freshman to win the race. During a wrestling match, Picard caught a
                        Ligonian with a reverse body lift
                        and pinned him down in the first fourteen seconds.</p>
